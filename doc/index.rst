:mod:`goldbug` --- classical cryptography toolkit
=================================================

.. module:: goldbug
   :synopsis: classical cryptography toolkit

:mod:`goldbug` aims to be a classical cryptography toolkit, providing
implementations of common ciphers as well as tools for studying and breaking
them.

It goes without saying (I hope) that none of the ciphers provided here should
ever be used for security; most of them were broken long before computers came
along, and none of them are secure now.

This package was named after E. A. Poe's short story, `The Gold-Bug`_.
